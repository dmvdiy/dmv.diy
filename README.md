## Mission Statement
#### This site is building off of the incredible work done by the admin of rva.rip, anarchism.nyc, bay.lgbt, and anarchism.boston. We are indebted to them for doing the critical work that allows us to begin to mobilize our communities away from platforms that do harm. Leaving these platforms should not come at the price of community, so we were excited to find out this work is already being done. 
#### If technology is to continue to be a part of organizing and building things together, I believe that it is crucial for us to start investing in our own online infrastructure instead of relying on companies that compromise our safety. At this time, Google Calendar seems like a necessary evil for running this site effectively, but I am actively looking for alternatives that allow the same level of collaboration.
